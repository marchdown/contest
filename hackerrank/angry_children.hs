---- still too slow. possible solutions:
-- use array instead of list.
--
--
----
-- process values once, when reading them
-- â†‘ won't work: input is unsorted
----
-- well, collect them into heap as they come, and then
-- implement a sliding window over a heap.
-- the result should be simple, but the process an
-- interesting exercise. basically,
-- fmap window heap
